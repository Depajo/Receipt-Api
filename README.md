# Self evaluation
I managed to implement all the required features except for one extra feature. Creating API felt clear and quite easy. The frontend site works well, but I would like to add feedback for the user. The most challenging part was the documentation, because we were using a new environment (Swagger). I would evaluate this project a 4.
